# Terminal-Solitaire
A python implementation of the Solitaire game, designed to work from the command line.
The newest version of the game uses curses to detect mouse inout, keyboard presses and to speed up the redrawing of frames. It also prevents the terminal from flashing, which was a rather prevalent problem in earlier versions.  
The main aim of the project is to create version of Solitaire, that runs on the command line, looks fine visually amd responds to real time input while providing access to its source code.
The code is free to reuse and to tinker with
